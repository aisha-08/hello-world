# hello-world
Hello wonderful people!

My name is Aisha Ahmed. I'm from Bangladesh, and I live in Qatar. I study at the Cambridge School in Doha, Qatar.
I have great interest in programming, and my favorite languages are HTML and CSS.
I love listening to music, reading, watching sunsets, sleeping, and cats!
